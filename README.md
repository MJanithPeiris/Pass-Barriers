# Pass-Barriers
Pass Barriers is a game created with the cooperation of Augmented Reality. The game is very similar to the game 'Cubefield'. Pass Barriers consists of 4 different game levels and the number of barriers increase with the level to make the game complicated and harder for the user. The user object is a cube. And the aim of the game is to collect green coins while avoiding the red ones, green coins act as points while red coins act as bombs. As an added feature this game can be played by people with colour blindness. People with red-green blindness will see the point coins in yellow and bombs in blue and people with blue-yellow blindness will see the point coins in green and bombs in red. Players without any visual impairments will also see the game from the blue-yellow version (Point coins in green, bomb coins in red). The surrounding scenery in this game is a real world background since it is a game revolving around Augmented Reality.
